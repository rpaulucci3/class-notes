    \section{Relational Algebra}
    
    SQL is a standard. MySQL doesn't implement all the standards, but includes extensions.
    
    Relational algebra is a family of algebras used for modelling the data stored in relational databases, and defining queries on it.\\
    
    We can have a command like SELECT * FROM 
    
    WHERE (filter out rows) 
    
    GROUP BY 
    
    HAVING (filter out groups) 
    
    ORDER BY\\
    
    \textbf{Aggregate functions:} count, sum, min, max, avg\\
    
    \textbf{Relational algebra symbols:}
    
    select: $\sigma$
    
    project: $\pi$
    
    rename: $\rho$
    
    order by: $\tau$
    
    group by: $\gamma$
    
    natural join: $\bowtie$
    
    Cartesian product: $\times$\\
    
    Example: $\pi$ fname, lname ($\sigma$ fname = 'john', lname = 'smith' EMPLOYEE)\\
    
    \textbf{Set operations}
    
    $\cup$ union, $\cap$ intersection, $-$ difference, $\times$ cross product
