    \textbf{Passwords}
    
    Length 6 to 8, alphanumeric: $P = P_6 + P_7 + P_8 = 36^6 + 36^7 + 36^8$  
    
    $P_6 = (26+10)^6 = 36^6$
    
    If it must contain at least one digit: calculate $P_n$, but subtract all the possibilities that do not contain at least one digit (i.e, the ones that are all letters). \textit{Inclusion/exclusion.}
    
    $P_{6*} = P_6 - (26)^6$
    
    $P_{7*} = P_7 - (26)^7$
    
    $P_{8*} = P_8 - (26)^8$\\
    
    \textbf{Bit strings}
    
    Number of bit strings with length 8 that start with a 1 or end with 00 (inclusive OR).
    
    Number of strings that start with 1 + Number of strings that end with 00 $-$ number of strings that start with 1 and end with 00 (to avoid double counting)
    
    $(1 * 2^7) + (2^6 * 1 * 1) - (1 * 2^5 * 1 * 1)$
    
    If the OR was exclusive, we would subtract $2^5$ twice.\\
    
    Bit strings of length 4 without consecutive 1s.
    
    $\{0000, 0001, 0010, 0100, 0101, 1000, 1001, 1010\}$
    
    Use a tree with tree pruning to find possible strings.
